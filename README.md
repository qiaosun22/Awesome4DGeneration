- Marigold: Repurposing Diffusion-Based Image Generators for Monocular Depth Estimation
  [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02145)|[Code](https://github.com/prs-eth/Marigold)\
  Proposed an image diffuson model exceling in monocular depth estimation.\
  Core principle: leveraging the rich visual knowledge contained in modern generative image models.\
  The finetuning data is synthesized.

- TC4D: Trajectory-Conditioned Text-to-4D Generation
  [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17920)|[Code](https://github.com/sherwinbahmani/tc4d?tab=readme-ov-file)\
  Background: Existing models are limited in generating large-scale motion due to their confined representation methods.\
  TC4D addresses this by decomposing motion into global (rigid transformation along a spline trajectory) and local (deformations aligned with global trajectory) components, using supervision from text-to-video models.\
  This enables the creation of scenes with complex motion paths and enhanced visual fidelity, validated through qualitative evaluation and user studies.
